# Firebase Realtime Database: Intermittent Data Update Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Firebase Realtime Database project where data updates were not consistently reflected in the database, despite successful client-side write operations.  The issue was intermittent and difficult to debug using standard methods.

## Bug Description
The client-side code successfully executed `ref.update()` and `ref.set()` calls, with no apparent errors.  However, the data in the Realtime Database would not always reflect the changes. This inconsistent behavior made identifying the root cause challenging. 

## Solution
The solution involves verifying the database rules and ensuring that they allow the type of write operations being performed. In addition, checking the client side code for any potential race conditions or improper data handling. A detailed example solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`
