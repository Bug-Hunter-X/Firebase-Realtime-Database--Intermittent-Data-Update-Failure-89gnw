//Check Database Rules
//Ensure that Firebase Realtime Database security rules allow the write operations you are performing.
//Inconsistent behavior could be due to insufficient security rules.

//Handle potential race conditions:
//In the client-side application, ensure there are no race conditions that might overwrite updates before they can be reflected in the database. 
//Add proper error handling for failed database operations. 

//Verify data integrity:
//Check that the data you're attempting to update is properly formatted and does not contain unexpected values that could cause update failures. 

// Example demonstrating proper error handling:
database.ref('path/to/data').update(newData).then(() => {
  console.log('Data updated successfully!');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error updating data:', error);
});
